Absolutely. The idea of enhancing LLM reliability for real-world applications is highly motivating to me. Having engaged deeply with these models as both a user and a critic, I understand where they excel and where they fall short. This makes the role an excellent fit, giving me the chance to apply analytical skills, creativity, and precise attention to detail to improve model performance.
